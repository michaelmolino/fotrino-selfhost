Fotrino is a photo gallery, social sharing site, and photo management tool.

This project is actively being developed and is not yet ready for use. Until I reach version 1.0, **updates might break existing installs** (eg. I won't provide DB migrations).

**Privacy Warning** The [URLs to access your photos](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) are valid for 24 hours and will work even if you are logged out. Someone with access to your browser history/cache could access your photos.

Feel free to use this live demo as a playground where you can upload photos. It is always the most up to date version of the code. Note that I regularly delete the DB and photos so don't use it to actually store important photos!

## [Self Hosting](https://github.com/michaelmolino/fotrino-selfhost)

#### Intro

Note: You'll need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. You'll also need `sudo` to modify your hosts file.

**THIS IS SUPER INSECURE AND, AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS, USES COMPLETELY MOCKED AUTHENTICATION.**

This quickstart will get a hacked together, non-production version of Fotrino running locally (hopefully!). I do plan on providing cleaner and easier self-hosting options in the future.

#### Just do this stuff once!

```bash
# Check out the code
# You don't need any other repos
git clone https://github.com/michaelmolino/fotrino-selfhost.git
cd fotrino-selfhost
# Generate a self signed certificate
# You can just press enter for all the questions
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -keyout ./ssl/private.key -out ./ssl/public.crt -config ssl.conf
# Add some entries to your hosts file
echo "127.0.0.1   fotrino" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1   mock-oauth-server" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1   minio" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

#### Start Fotrino

```bash
# Start dependencies
docker-compose run --rm dependencies
# Start the service
docker-compose up -d fotrino-worker fotrino-backend fotrino-frontend nginx
```

**Now visit [https://fotrino:4443](https://fotrino:4443).**

#### Stop Fotrino

```bash
# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

#### Troubleshooting

Your browser should complain that Fotrino cannot be trusted. You should visit each of these domains and accept the certificate.

- https://mock-oauth-server:4444 (a 404 is OK)
- https://minio:9000
- https://fotrino:4443

If you can't accept the certificate, try [this](https://medium.com/@dblazeski/chrome-bypass-net-err-cert-invalid-for-development-daefae43eb12).

#### Cleaning Up

If you'd like to trash all of your photos and DB you can just delete the `./minio` and `./postgres` folders. They will be recreated the next time you start the services.

#### Updating

Updates are likely to **break your existing install**. You should delete `./minio` and `./postgres` to avoid problems.

```bash
# Pull the latest self-host to make sure you have the latest docker-compose.yml and settings
git pull
# Update the docker images
docker-compose pull
```

#### Dependencies

Additionally, Fotrino needs a webserver, an S3 compatible bucket and an identity provider to run. [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), [Minio](https://min.io/), and a [mock oauth server](https://github.com/michaelmolino/mock-oauth-server) are used in this example setup. If you need to expose your instance you'll need a real identity provider. [Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/) is supported, as well as Facebook, Github, Gmail, and Reddit.
